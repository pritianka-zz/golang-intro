# golang-intro
Custom Golang course

This is the central repository for all the Golang study group's materials. We will post meeting updates, weekly goals, and everything else here. Anyone who wants to study with us can follow along passively or message me to join the meetings actively. 

While we don't know if this is the best approach to learning Go, our experiences (the good and the bad) will be recorded here to help future readers make a good choice.
